Getting started - Public access
------------------------------------------

In order to maintain a consistent deployment environemnt the solutions should all be deployed from the project provided container
the container will run locally on your machine, it inculdes the automation tools required to run the soltuions.
most of the solutions are using terraform to create the cloud componenets that are required, the container also maintain the terraform state files.


.. NOTE:: The following instructions will create a volume on your docker host and will instruct you
          to store private information in the host volume. the information in the volume will persist
          on the host even after the container is terminated.


.. NOTE:: it is your responsability to properly maintain any private/sensitive information used when deploying the solutions
          those sensitive items can include ssh keys , cloud credentials and passwords.
